\section{Introduction}
Machine learning methods have seen widespread utilisation across all scientific disciplines, in situations where conventional algorithms are too cumbersome to implement for specific data-based and modelling tasks \cite{Carleo19}. Deep learning, loosely defined as machine learning with large datasets, parallel computation and scalable algorithms with many layers \cite{Goodfellow16}, has and continues to increase the range and complexity of possible applications of machine learning in the sciences \cite{Carleo19}. Any task applying deep learning to data with a grid-like form, such as images, likely involves the usage of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms \cite{Goodfellow16}. CNNs were conceived in 1989 by Yann LeCun et al. and successfully applied to recognition of handwritten characters \cite{LeCun89}. However, their astounding performance in the field of computer vision would not be fully realised until after breakthroughs in deep learning starting in 2006 \cite{Goodfellow16}. Their efficacy was further proven when Geoffrey Hinton \textit{et al.} entered a CNN into the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012, and won by a large margin \cite{ILSVRC15}.

Liquid crystal phases are in general identified by eye, directly from textures taken by polarised microscopy. Without adequate experience, this can prove a difficult task because certain unique liquid crystal phases, generated by often minor changes in structural properties, can have similar textural appearances \cite{Dierking03}. Our project aims to test the viability of machine learning algorithms as tools to assist phase identification. CNNs are particularly suitable due to their prevalence in image classification, and so form the core of our investigations. Current literature in this specific topic is limited, and the approaches so far have mostly involved the usage of simulated textures in the training of models \cite{Sigaki20, Minor20}. Sigaki et al. have demonstrated the viability of CNNs in isotropic and nematic phase texture classification and in the prediction of physical liquid crystal properties \cite{Sigaki20}. Our study further explores and attempts to push the limits of the classification task across a wider range of phases, utilising real experimental data produced by polarised microscopy.

This project report will first provide a brief overview of the physics behind liquid crystals and the capturing of their textures by polarised microscopy, as well as an introduction to machine learning, neural networks and CNNs. The details and results of our investigations into phase classification will then be presented, as well as an outlook to further study.
